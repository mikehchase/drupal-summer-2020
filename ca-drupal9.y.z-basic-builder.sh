    (1) Go to Drupal.org - get the latest Druapl 9.y.z CORE version number   
      
    (2) Logon to your Codeanywhere account 
    
 *  (3) Create a new connection of type PHP - PHP Development stack with Apache, PHP, MySQL, 
          phpMyAdmin and Composer pre-installed 
        We are using a shared Codeanywhere space - prepend your initials to the connection name

    (4) On the container info TAB 
    	 Record the root username on the first line 
    	 [root user without password]
    	 
    (5) From the container info page, select and access and log int phpMyAdmin on another TAB   
     
    (6) Login to phpMyAdmin as root user name and no password    
    
    (7) Select Databases TAB  
       
    (8) Create a database named drupalxyz# - where xyz are your initials and number is a single digit number
        - we are using a shared Codeanywhere account, so the database name must be unique    
        
    (9) Back on the Codeanywhere dashboard, upload this script file to the workspace
    
    (10) Open the bash command window and run the following BASH command to make the script executable
        [your-name:/~workspace $] chmod +x ca-drupal9.y.z-basic-builder.sh 
        
    (11) In the BASH command window run this script
        [your-name:/~workspace $] ./ca-drupal9.y.z-basic-builder.sh 9.0.1 
        the script will download the Drupal 9.y.z core files and establish folders for running the Drupal 9 install script 
        
    (12) In another TAB Enter the URL of the application over HTTPS - this will start the Drupal 8 site building script 
    
    (13) Fill out the required fields and build your Drupal 9 site
         (1) use a short all lowercase UNIQUE Drupal 9 site name - using your initials
         (2) The database (DB) is what you named it in step 8
	     (3) Always set the country and city & check both the update checkboxes 
	        
    (14) This script copies the example.settings.local.php to create the settings.local.php in the sites/default folders
       
    (15) When the build script completes, press the 'Visit your new site link' and record the URL of this site
